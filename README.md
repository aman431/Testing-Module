## Way of Testing 

To test a module or function we need to install mocha and chai. These two module is used for testing we can install this module by using npm. To install mocha and chai command is **npm install mocha chai --save-dev** in this command --save-dev install all the developer dependencies which you required to test.<br/>

## Steps to execute a Testing

- First we need to install npm check the offical website of npm and you will get how to install.<br/>

- After you install npm then start to execute a command **npm init** which start to create a package.json file<br/>
Package.json is a most important file which contain all the information that is required to test a module or develope a module. Execute a above command and you will get the result<br/>

- After that install npm i mocha chai --save-dev it install mocha and chai which contain developer dependencies.

- After install you will see that dependencies in package.json file.Now in package.json in script part there is a test set a mocha over there.

- After this location of testing is set now you test a file but before this you need to write a code for testing look my source file how to write a test code.
